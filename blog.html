        <p class="blog-caption">
          This summer I went to Croatia with my mom and sister for eight days!
          We started in London where we helped move my sister, Abby, into her
          new flat for her first year of grad school at King's College! We then
          took a flight to Split, and proceeded to stay two nights there. A food
          tour on the second night was definitely the highlight, as we went with
          a fun group and got to learn about the history of the city while
          getting to eat every half hour or so! After that we traveled to the
          island of Hvar for a three night stay. In our time there, we went on a
          boat tour to the various surrounding islands where we did some
          snorkeling and cliff jumping. We also did a bike tour through the
          countryside of Hvar which was another highlight of the trip! We spent
          our last night in Dubrovnik before I hopped on a flight back to
          California alone. My sister is still in London at school, and my mom
          plans on traveling Europe, Asia, and Africa for the next year or so.
