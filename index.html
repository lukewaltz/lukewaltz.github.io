    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Luke Waltz and I am a third year
      <strong>computer science</strong> student from Golden Colorado!<br />
      I am hoping to soon be a member of <em>Hack4Impact CalPoly</em>, and am
      currently a software intern at <br /><em>OpenPark</em>, a small startup
      out of LA! My hobbies include surfing, climbing and golfing, and I<br />
      used to dive and play tennis back in high school.
