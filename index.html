            Hi! My name is Luke Waltz and I am a third year
            <strong>computer science</strong> student from Golden Colorado!<br />
            I am hoping to soon be a member of <em>Hack4Impact CalPoly</em>, and
            am currently a software intern at <br /><em>OpenPark</em>, a small
            startup out of LA! My hobbies include surfing, climbing and golfing,
            and I<br />
            used to dive and play tennis back in high school.
